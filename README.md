# feed-forward-NeuralNetwork
## Build a neural network from scratch using Numpy.
In this project, I've build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! (To predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day).
By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other important concepts.<br />
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Dependencies
The directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebook.<br />
To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
